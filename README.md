## Overview of the Task

The task is to design a website for college students similar to the mockup. The task is divided into two parts. You will cover the first part in this class and the second part in the next class.The screenshot attached is the first part of the website which we will cover today. Once you start to design your website, there are certain steps to be considered:


## Steps to consider while creating the layout.
Never start to design a website without following a proper step by step procedure. Following are certain steps that you should always bring into practice when creating the website.

#### Step 01:
> Analyze the layout of the website carefully to identify the different sections present on it. 

#### Step 02:
> Identify the semantic tags both having visual effect and not having visual effect. Example notice if there is any sidebar or a list of elements so that you know which html tags you will require.

#### Step 03:
> If there are links present on the website, use hyperlinks for those parts.

#### Step 04:
> Once you have identified the visual and non visual semantic tags, the second step is to start building the html markup of your project. You should be careful that you enclose all related content in one singular tag. Like enclosing header elements in a header tag. This helps in styling them easily too.

#### Step 05:
> Elements that are related to one another in a particular section can be placed in div. This will allow you to give similar style properties to them in one go. 

#### Step 06:
> Use comments in html and css files to label each section so that you can easily access a certain section by simply looking at the comments

#### Step 07:
> Use appropriate naming convention for the class names you give to html tags. This is very important so that later you do not find it difficult to manage your stylesheets.

#### Step 08:
> Time to add CSS to your html markup. It is a good practice to always use an external stylesheet to style html tags.

#### Step 09:
> Start with using wildcard property to give a similar look and feel to your entire project. If there is a property you want throughout the design, declare it in the wildcard property. 

#### Step 10:
> It is a good practice to use shorthand properties to make your code appear neat. For example if you want to set margin for all four directions, use the shorthand property of margin instead of individually declaring it for each direction.

#### Step 11:
> Notice which elements of the website require the entire row width and which elements should be placed side by side. Use correct CSS property to adjust the default display behaviour of tags.

#### Step 12:
> Now you can start adding background colors to the elements of your website. Also work on colors of font and specify properties like font size and family. 

#### Step 13:
> See if you have used hyperlinks in your project, if so then use style properties to change the default hyperlink behaviour and style it so that it looks exactly how you want.[HINT: Use box model properties to change appearance of hyperlinks]

#### Step 14:
> Once you have all elements with proper colors and display, start working on aligning your text. You have studied alignment in the box model lesson.

#### Step 15:
> After completing a section, compare it with the mockup to see if you have missed out anything.
	
#### Step 16:
> Finally, you can compare your entire design with the design provided in the mockup.
